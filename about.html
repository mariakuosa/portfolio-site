    <h1>About my career path</h1>
    <div>
      <p>I’m Maria, marketing professional who always looks things from customer perspective. Design thinking and creating services that add value and support both company and its’ customers business are also part of my skill set.</p>
      <p>I’ve plenty of experience in digital marketing, marketing automation and data driven marketing in B2B field. Content marketing is one of the keys to catch attention in today’s world and I’m able to write interesting stories around different topics.</p>
      <p>I’ve been always excited about digital services and their usability and I’ve run extranet projects and defined web site functionalities and outlook. Now I’m enhancing my own skills with frontend development to better understand how to actually transform the design to a real digital product. I want to learn to talk ”code” to be able to challenge the developers’ views on what is possible and what is not. Digital transformation is more than code, it is the way of looking things from new perspective.</p>
      <p>I’m cooperative, efficient and vibrant person, who is open to new ideas, likes to listen and loves to learn new things. I believe that strategic planning is the key for success and actual execution gives an opportunity to see the strategy in practice. I ensure that projects get done but I’m also able to change the direction quickly when necessary.</p>
      <p>My work experience have provided me with skills to collaborate with numerous stakeholders and enable teams to agree on the most optimum solutions from customer perspective. I enjoy working with different groups, giving and participating in trainings and ensuring best practices are shared constantly.</p>
      <p>In personal life I spend time with my family, I enjoy outdoor activities with my kids and I can read storybooks to them for hours. I do Nordic walking all year round, skiing in the winter and golfing in summer. History, poetry and going to theatre are close to my heart.</p>
