  <h1>Hello! I'm Maria Kuosa, soon to be UX designer and experienced digital marketing professional.</h1>
  <h1>Below some of my worksamples featuring UX design and design thinking.</h1>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>User persona</h2>
      <img src="img/User_Persona_940.jpg" width="600" alt="User persona" >
      <ul>
        <li>Users personas area great to show what kind of people are going to use the service/product.</li>
        <li>When creating a persona it can’t just be designers “ideal person” but the facts need to be real and gained through qualitative and/or quantitative research among potential target group.</li>
        <li>I find this piece of information very useful when making strategic decisions for the service/product.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Empathy map</h2>
      <img src="img/Empathy_Map_940.jpg" width="600" alt="Empathy map" >
      <ul>
        <li>This empathy map was created to ensure that everybody in the project will have as much information as possible of the potential customer/user of the digital product.</li>
        <li>Empathy maps shows the needs of the customer and brings more insights on the user persona.</li>
        <li>I find this very useful to create a truly customer centric product/service.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>User flow</h2>
      <img src="img/USer_Flow_940.jpg" width="600" alt="User flow" >
      <ul>
        <li>User flows helps to understand the steps customer takes to complete certain action.</li>
        <li>Usually a service/product is created to make customer/user to complete certain task and user flow makes the purpose clear.</li>
        <li>This is cost efficient way to explore the service structure and attention goes to the steps and not to the design.</li>
        <li>I find this very useful step in design process that helps and speeds up the wireframing and mock-up phase of the project.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Iterative design</h2>
      <img src="img/Iterative_Design_940.jpg" width="600" alt="Work Sample 4" >
      <ul>
        <li>Iterative design process is the way to go in many cases.</li>
        <li>It is difficult to create a perfect product once but constantly updating the design based on customer/user feedback leads to best results.</li>
        <li>Starting with pen and paper is still very wise and then moving to more detailed versions.</li>
        <li>I find it very useful to start with very plain design as it very fast gives an idea if something is possible or not.</li>
        <li>And when product is launched, design work shouldn’t stop but be constantly updated based on data gathered through various channels.</li>
      </ul>
